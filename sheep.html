    Have a html page that has a button on it, and an empty div <div id="sheep-container></div>
    
    When clicked it adds a new div to the empty one, with some text inside it that reads Sheep  then the number of the sheep starting from 0, and also has an id sheep-  then the number starting from 0
    
    It does the above using a class that is called using new Sheep() whenever the button is clicked
